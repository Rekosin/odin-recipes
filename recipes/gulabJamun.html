    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups water</li>
      <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
      <li>2 drops rose water (Optional)</li>
      <li>1 pinch saffron (Optional)</li>
      <li>½ cup instant dry milk powder (such as Carnation®)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
      <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine water, sugar, cardamom, rose water, and saffron in a saucepan;
        bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until consistency is syrupy, 5
        to 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix milk powder, flour, and baking soda in a bowl until well-combined.
        Slowly mix in butter and yogurt until dough comes together. Let gulab
        dough rest for 5 minutes. Shape into smooth balls the size of pennies.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees
        C). Test the temperature of the oil by dropping in a small piece of
        dough. When it sits at the bottom of the pan for 1 minute before coming
        to the surface, the oil is ready.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fry 4 gulab balls at a time, stirring carefully, until dark golden brown
        on all sides, about 2 minutes. Drain on a paper-towel lined plate.
        Repeat with remaining gulab.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring syrup back up to a boil and drop in fried gulab. Remove from heat
        and let them soak in the syrup, covered, 45 minutes to 1 hour.
      </li>
    </ol>
